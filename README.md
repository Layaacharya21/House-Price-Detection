# House Price Detection

## Overview
House Price Detection is a machine learning project designed to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors. This project utilizes regression algorithms to analyze historical data and provide accurate price predictions for properties.

## Project Features
- Predict house prices based on input features.
- Data preprocessing for handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- Feature selection and engineering to improve model performance.
- Visualization of key data insights and model predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - TensorFlow
- **Machine Learning Models**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is AmesHousing[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashanknecrothapa/ames-housing-dataset] Dataset. 

### Source
The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or other publicly available resources. Ensure you comply with the dataset’s usage policy.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-detection.git
   cd house-price-detection
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the script to preprocess the data:
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. Predict house prices using the trained model:
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```
4. Visualize data insights and predictions:
   ```bash
   python visualize.py
   ```

## Model Description
The project uses the following machine learning models:
1. **Linear Regression**: A simple yet effective model for predicting prices based on features.
2. **Random Forest**: An ensemble method for handling non-linear relationships and improving accuracy.
3. **Gradient Boosting**: For enhanced predictions by combining weak learners.

## Results
- Achieved **R-squared** value of 0.85 on the test dataset.
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 20,000 units.
- It shows the ID of the house and the predicted SalePrice of the house.

Visualization of actual vs. predicted prices shows a strong correlation, demonstrating the model’s effectiveness.

## Future Enhancements
- Include additional features such as proximity to amenities, crime rates, and school ratings.
- Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Django.
- Optimize hyperparameters further using Grid Search or Random Search.
- Integrate advanced models like XGBoost or neural networks for better performance.
